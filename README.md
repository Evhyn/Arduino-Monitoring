# MonitoringSystem
Temperature and Humidity monitoring system.
This system is build to monitor temperature and humidity remotely.

Php, C programming (arduino), html, and some basic of mySQL database knowledge are required to understand and build the whole system.

The hardware setup for this system are as follows:
 <li> Esp8266 / Nodemcu</li>
 <li> DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor)</li>
 <li> Wi-Fi Hotspot</li>




I made 4 versions of arduino code. If you are using ESP8266/nodemcu and mySQL to store data, then ESP8266_sensor_over_LAN code is suitable for you.
